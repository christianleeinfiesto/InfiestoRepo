#1. Create a data frame using the table below.

#a. Write the codes.

respondents <- 1:20
sex <- c(2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2)
fathers_occupation <- c(1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1)
persons_at_home <- c(5, 7, 3, 8, 5, 9, 6, 7, 8, 4, 7, 5, 4, 7, 8, 8, 3, 11, 7, 6)
siblings_at_school <- c(6, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 5, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 3, 2)
types_of_houses <- c(1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2)

df <- data.frame(
  Respondents = respondents,
  Sex = sex,
  Fathers_Occupation = fathers_occupation,
  Persons_at_Home = persons_at_home,
  Siblings_at_School = siblings_at_school,
  Types_of_Houses = types_of_houses
)
df

#b. Describe the data. Get the structure or the summary of the data
str(df)
summary(df)

#c. Is the mean number of siblings attending is 5?
mean(df$Siblings_at_School)

#d. Extract the 1st two rows and then all the columns using the subsetting functions.
df[1:2, ]

#e. Extract 3rd and 5th row with 2nd and 4th column.
df[c(3, 5), c(2, 4)]

#f. Select the variable types of houses then store the vector that results as types_houses.
types_houses <- df$Types_of_Houses
types_houses

#g. Select only all Males respondent that their father occupation was farmer.
subset(df, Sex == 1 & Fathers_Occupation == 1)

#h. Select only all females respondent that have greater than or equal to 5 number of siblings attending school.
subset(df, Sex == 2 & Siblings_at_School >= 5)
```

```{r}
#2. Write a R program to create an empty data frame. Using the following codes:
#df = data.frame(Ints=integer(),
#Doubles=double(), Characters=character(),
#Logicals=logical(),
#Factors=factor(),
#stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

#print("Structure of the empty dataframe:")
#print(str(df))

#a. Describe the results.
#The R code creates an empty data frame with five columns: integers, doubles, characters, logicals, and factors. The `str()` function displays that the data frame has these columns but no rows. Each column is an empty vector of its respective type, ready to hold data later.
```
3.
```{r}
#a. Import the csv file into the R environment.
household_data <- read.csv("/cloud/project/ChristianLee/Worksheet#3/HouseholdData.csv")
household_data

#b. Convert the Sex into factor using factor() function and change it into integer.[Legend: Male = 1 and Female = 2].
household_data$Sex <- factor(household_data$Sex, levels = c("Male", "Female"), labels = c(1, 2))
household_data

#c. Convert the Type of Houses into factor and change it into integer. [Legend: Wood = 1; Congrete = 2; Semi-Congrete = 3].
household_data$Types_of_Houses <- factor(household_data$Types_of_Houses, levels = c("Wood", "Congrete", "Semi-congrete"), labels = c(1, 2, 3))
household_data

#d. On fatherâ€™s occupation, factor it as Farmer = 1; Driver = 2; and Others = 3.
household_data$Fathers_Occupation <- factor(household_data$Fathers_Occupation, levels = c(1, 2, 3), labels = c("Farmer", "Driver", "Others"))
household_data

#e. Select only all females respondent that has a father whose occupation is driver.
female_drivers <- subset(household_data, Sex == 2 & Fathers_Occupation == "Driver")
female_drivers

#f. Select the respondents that have greater than or equal to 5 number of siblings attending school.
many_siblings <- subset(household_data, Siblings_at_School >= 5)
many_siblings

#The chart suggests a period of heightened negative sentiment, especially on July 15 and 21. Neutral and positive sentiments are steady but less frequent. The data could reflect responses to specific events that triggered a wave of negative reactions on social media, with the exact events requiring further investigation to understand the context.
