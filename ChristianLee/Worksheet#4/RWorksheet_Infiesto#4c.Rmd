```{r}
#1. Use the dataset mpg
#A data frame with 234 rows and 11 variables:
#’ \describe{
#’ \item{manufacturer}{manufacturer name}
#’ \item{model}{model name}
#’ \item{displ}{engine displacement, in litres}
#’ \item{year}{year of manufacture}
#’ \item{cyl}{number of cylinders}
#’ \item{trans}{type of transmission}
#’ \item{drv}{the type of drive train, where f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd}
#’ \item{cty}{city miles per gallon}
#’ \item{hwy}{highway miles per gallon}
#’ \item{fl}{fuel type}
#’ \item{class}{"type" of car}
#’ }

#a. Show your solutions on how to import a csv file into the environment.
setwd("C:/users/USER/downloads")
mpg <- read.csv("mpg.csv")
str(mpg)


#b. Which variables from mpg dataset are categorical?
cat_var <- names(mpg)[sapply(mpg, function(x) is.factor(x) || is.character(x))]
print(cat_var)

#c. Which are continuous variables?
num_vars <- names(mpg)[sapply(mpg, is.numeric)]
num_vars
```
```{r}
#2. Which manufacturer has the most models in this data set? Which model has the most variations? Show your answer.
setwd("C:/users/USER/downloads")
mpg <- read.csv("mpg.csv")

#a. Group the manufacturers and find the unique models. Show your codes and result.
library(dplyr)
manufacturer <- mpg %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(num_models = n_distinct(model)) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_models))
print("Manufacturer with the most models:")
print(manufacturer)

unique_mods <- mpg %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(uniq_mods = list(unique(model)))
print(unique_mods)

#b. Graph the result by using plot() and ggplot(). Write the codes and its result.
barplot(manufacturer$num_models,
        names.arg = manufacturer$manufacturer,
        las = 2,
        col = "pink",
        main = "Number of Models by Manufacturer",
        ylab = "Number of Models")
#2. Same dataset will be used. You are going to show the relationship of the modeland the manufacturer.

#a. What does ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point() show?
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = model, y = manufacturer)) +
  geom_point()

#b. For you, is it useful? If not, how could you modify the data to make it more informative?
# - No, the scatterplot is not very useful because it looks too crowded. I would group the data by manufacturer and model count, then use a bar chart to make it clearer.
