```{r}
#1. Use the dataset mpg
#A data frame with 234 rows and 11 variables:
#’ \describe{
#’ \item{manufacturer}{manufacturer name}
#’ \item{model}{model name}
#’ \item{displ}{engine displacement, in litres}
#’ \item{year}{year of manufacture}
#’ \item{cyl}{number of cylinders}
#’ \item{trans}{type of transmission}
#’ \item{drv}{the type of drive train, where f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd}
#’ \item{cty}{city miles per gallon}
#’ \item{hwy}{highway miles per gallon}
#’ \item{fl}{fuel type}
#’ \item{class}{"type" of car}
#’ }

#a. Show your solutions on how to import a csv file into the environment.
setwd("C:/users/USER/downloads")
mpg <- read.csv("mpg.csv")
str(mpg)


#b. Which variables from mpg dataset are categorical?
cat_var <- names(mpg)[sapply(mpg, function(x) is.factor(x) || is.character(x))]
print(cat_var)

#c. Which are continuous variables?
num_vars <- names(mpg)[sapply(mpg, is.numeric)]
num_vars
```
```{r}
#2. Which manufacturer has the most models in this data set? Which model has the most variations? Show your answer.
setwd("C:/users/USER/downloads")
mpg <- read.csv("mpg.csv")

#a. Group the manufacturers and find the unique models. Show your codes and result.
library(dplyr)
manufacturer <- mpg %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(num_models = n_distinct(model)) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_models))
print("Manufacturer with the most models:")
print(manufacturer)

unique_mods <- mpg %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(uniq_mods = list(unique(model)))
print(unique_mods)

#b. Graph the result by using plot() and ggplot(). Write the codes and its result.
barplot(manufacturer$num_models,
        names.arg = manufacturer$manufacturer,
        las = 2,
        col = "pink",
        main = "Number of Models by Manufacturer",
        ylab = "Number of Models")
#2. Same dataset will be used. You are going to show the relationship of the modeland the manufacturer.

#a. What does ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point() show?
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = model, y = manufacturer)) +
  geom_point()

#b. For you, is it useful? If not, how could you modify the data to make it more informative?
# - No, the scatterplot is not very useful because it looks too crowded. I would group the data by manufacturer and model count, then use a bar chart to make it clearer.

#3. Plot the model and the year using ggplot(). Use only the top 20 observations. Write the codes and its 
top_20 <- mpg %>% top_n(20, displ)
ggplot(top_20, aes(x = model, y = year)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Top 20 Models by Year")

#4. Using the pipe (%>%), group the model and get the number of cars per model. Show codes and its result
num <- mpg %>%
  group_by(model) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

#a. Plot using geom_bar() using the top 20 observations only. The graphs shoudl have a title, labels and colors. Show code and results.
 ggplot(num[1:20,],
       aes(x = reorder(model, count), y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Top 20 Models by Count", x = "Model", y = "Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
#b. Plot using the geom_bar() + coord_flip() just like what is shown below. Show codes and its result.
 ggplot(num[1:20,], aes(x = reorder(model, count), y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightpink") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 20 Models by Count (Flipped)", x = "Count", y = "Model")

#5. Plot the relationship between cyl - number of cylinders and displ - engine displacement usinggeom_point with aesthetic color = engine displacement. Title should be “Relationship between No. of Cylinders and Engine Displacement”.
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cyl, y = displ, color = displ)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Relationship between No. of Cylinders and Engine Displacement",
    x = "Number of Cylinders",
    y = "Engine Displacement")
#a. How would you describe its relationship? Show the codes and its result.
# - The plot shows that as the number of cylinders increases, engine displacement usually increases. Cars with more cylinders tend to have bigger engines. However, there is some variation even within the same cylinder group.
