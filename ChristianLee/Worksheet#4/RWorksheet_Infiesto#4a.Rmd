#1. The table below shows the data about shoe size and height.
#a. Describe the data.
#The table shows information about peopleâ€™s shoe size, height, and gender (M for male, F for female). It lists these details for different individuals, allowing us to compare shoe sizes and heights between males and females. This data can help us see patterns or differences between the two groups.

#b. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height. What its result? Show the R scripts.
# Create the data frame
household_data <- data.frame(
  Shoe_Size = c(6.5, 9.0, 8.5, 8.5, 10.5, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 13.0, 10.5, 10.5, 8.5, 10.5, 12.0, 10.5, 13.0, 11.5, 8.5, 5.0, 10.0, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 10.5, 10.5, 9.0, 13.0, 11.0, 9.0, 13.0),

#c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.
mean_shoe_size <- mean(household_data$Shoe_Size)
mean_height <- mean(household_data$Height)

#d. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?
