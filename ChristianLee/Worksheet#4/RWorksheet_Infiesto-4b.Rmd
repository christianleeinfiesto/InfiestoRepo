#1. Using the for loop, create an R script that will display a 5x5 matrix as shown in Figure 1. It must contain vectorA = [1,2,3,4,5] and a 5 x 5 zero 
#Hint Use abs() function to get the absolute value

vectorA <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
matrixA <- matrix(0,5,5)
for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in 1:5) {
  matrixA[i, j] <- abs(vectorA[i] - vectorA[j])
  }
}
print(matrixA)

#2. Print the string "*" using for() function. The output should be the same as shown in Figure

for (i in 1:5) {
  line <- ""
  for (j in 1:i) {
    line <- paste(line, "*", sep = " ")
  }
  print(line)

#3. Get an input from the user to print the Fibonacci sequence starting from the 1st input up to 500. Use repeat and break statements. Write the R Scripts and its output.

#4. Import the dataset as shown in Figure 1 you have created previously.

#a. What is the R script for importing an excel or a csv file? Display the first 6 rows of the dataset? Show your codes and its result

#b. Create a subset for gender(female and male). How many observations are there in Male? How about in Female? Write the R scripts and its output.

num_females <- sum(data$Gender == "F")

num_females
num_males

#c. Create a graph for the number of males and females for Household Data. Use plot(), chart type = barplot. Make sure to place title, legends, and colors. Write the R scripts and its result.
