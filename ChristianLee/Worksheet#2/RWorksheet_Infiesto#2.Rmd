7.

# 7. R has actually lots of built-in datasets. For example, the rivers data “gives the lengths (in miles) of 141 “major” rivers in North America, as compiled by the US Geological Survey”.

Create a vector data with 7 elements, containing the number of elements (length) in rivers, their sum (sum), mean (mean), median(median), variance(var), standard deviation(sd), minimum (min) and maximum (max). data <- c(length(rivers), sum(rivers), mean(rivers), median(rivers), var(rivers), sd(rivers), min(rivers), max(rivers))
