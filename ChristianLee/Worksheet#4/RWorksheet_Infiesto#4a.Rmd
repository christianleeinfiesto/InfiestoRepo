#1. The table below shows the data about shoe size and height.
#a. Describe the data.
#The table shows information about peopleâ€™s shoe size, height, and gender (M for male, F for female). It lists these details for different individuals, allowing us to compare shoe sizes and heights between males and females. This data can help us see patterns or differences between the two groups.

#b. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height. What its result? Show the R scripts.
# Create the data frame
household_data <- data.frame(
  Shoe_Size = c(6.5, 9.0, 8.5, 8.5, 10.5, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 13.0, 10.5, 10.5, 8.5, 10.5, 12.0, 10.5, 13.0, 11.5, 8.5, 5.0, 10.0, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 10.5, 10.5, 9.0, 13.0, 11.0, 9.0, 13.0),
  Height = c(66.0, 68.0, 64.5, 65.0, 70.0, 64.0, 70.0, 72.0, 72.0, 74.5, 67.0, 71.0, 71.0, 67.0, 71.0, 77.0, 72.0, 59.0, 62.0, 72.0, 66.0, 64.0, 67.0, 73.0, 72.0, 69.0, 71.0, 69.0, 69.0, 70.0),

#c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.
mean_shoe_size <- mean(household_data$Shoe_Size)
mean_height <- mean(household_data$Height)
mean_shoe_size
mean_height

#d. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?
correlation <- cor(household_data$Shoe_Size, household_data$Height)

```{r}
#2. Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out the factor levels below the actual values.
# Create a character vector of months
months <- c("March", "April", "January", "November", "January", "September", "October", "September", "November", "August", "January", "November", "November", "February", "May", "August", "July", "December", "August", "August", "September", "November", "February", "April")
factor_months_vector <- factor(months)
print(factor_months_vector)
levels(factor_months_vector)


#3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. | Inter-pret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?
summary(months)
summary(factor_months_vector)
```
4.
```{r}
#4. Create a vector and factor for the table below.
factor_data <- rep(c("East", "West", "North"), c(1, 4, 3))
new_order_data <- factor(factor_data, levels = c("East", "West", "North"))
print(new_order_data)

```{r}
#5. Enter the data below in Excel with file name = import_march.csv

#a. Import the excel file into the Environment Pane using read.table() function.
data <- read.table("import_march.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",",na.strings = "")
print(data)
